# Realpython Project: Build a Contact Book App With Python, Textual, and SQLite

In this Let's code following a realpython tutorial:

- Create the contact book app’s TUI using Textual
- Handle the database operations using SQLite
- Connect the app’s TUI with the database code and make it functional

At the end of this project a functional contact book application will created allowing storage, retrival and management of contact information.

# Step 1: Create the Contact Book’s App With Textual

In this first step, you’ll create a minimal TUI application to provide the foundation on which you’ll start to build the contact book. You’ll also create the required project structure.

# Step 2: Build the Contact Book’s TUI

Now that the skeleton of the contact book app is built, start coding the main TUI. In this TUI, you have two main components. On the left side, you have the contacts list, which includes the contact’s name, phone number, and email address. On the right side, you have a panel with three buttons:

1. Add to add a new contact to the list
2. Delete to remove the selected contact from the list
3. Clear All to remove all contacts from the list

# Step 3: Set Up the Contact Book’s Database

At this point the Textual app has an appropriate TUI to build a contact book. In this section, code with be written to operate an SQLite database where the app will store the contact information persistently.
